    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img class ="test" src="hshot.jpg"/>
    <p>I am a Mechatronics Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a passion for turning ideas into practical, impactful solutions. From leading projects to contributing to making robotic projects, I’m driven by turning creative concepts into actual, working projects. Along the way, I’ve gained hands-on experience designing and building mechanical systems, creating functional prototypes, and developing autonomous and embedded systems. I’m experienced in CAD modeling and component design using SolidWorks, OnShape, and Fusion 360, and I’ve brought concepts to life through 3D printing, sensor integration, and microcontroller-based control systems. Through projects like line-following robots, ultrasonic radar systems, and model rockets, I’ve combined technical problem-solving with practical fabrication and testing, turning ideas from initial design into fully functional, real-world solutions. Through hands-on project management, I’ve learned to integrate technical skills with leadership and teamwork, ensuring ideas are developed efficiently and meaningfully.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Actively looking for internship opportunities to apply and expand my engineering experience.</p>
